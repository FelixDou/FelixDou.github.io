# Welcome to My Personal Website

My name is Félix Doublet, and I am currently pursuing my passion for Artificial Intelligence through research at the [SMILAB lab](https://smilab.org/en/) at Keio University, where I am a Master's student. My journey in AI is driven by a curiosity to understand the intersection between human cognition and machine intelligence. This website serves as a window into my research, thoughts, and ongoing projects in the realm of AI.

## Background

I am currently a Master’s student at Keio University, where I am involved in cutting-edge AI research at the SMILAB lab. My academic background is deeply rooted in engineering, where I have focused on the intricacies of machine learning and its applications. My studies have equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI, which I continue to build upon through my research.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working on several interdisciplinary projects that bridge the gap between AI and other fields, such as neuroscience and cognitive science. These experiences have enriched my understanding of how AI can be used to model complex systems and contribute to a broader understanding of intelligence, both artificial and human.

## What I Like

Beyond the realm of academia and research, I have a diverse set of interests that keep me grounded and inspired. I am passionate about exploring the ethical dimensions of AI, particularly how technology intersects with society and the implications of AI on our future.

In my free time, I enjoy delving into philosophical literature, which often informs my perspective on AI and the nature of consciousness. I am also an avid coder, constantly experimenting with new algorithms and technologies to push the boundaries of what is possible.

When I'm not engrossed in research or coding, I like to unwind by exploring nature, which provides me with a much-needed balance to the fast-paced world of AI. Whether it's hiking, reading, or simply reflecting on the deeper questions of life, these activities fuel my creativity and passion for my work.

## The Intersection of Thought and Machine

Artificial Intelligence is not just a field of study—it's a frontier where philosophy meets engineering, where our deepest questions about existence, consciousness, and the nature of thought are explored through algorithms and data.

As we push the boundaries of what machines can learn and do, we are confronted with profound questions: Can a machine truly think, or are we simply building increasingly complex reflections of our own minds? What does it mean for a machine to "understand"? Is there a future where AI transcends its creators, evolving beyond human comprehension?

AI challenges us to rethink what it means to be human. In a world where machines can mimic human behavior, the uniqueness of our own consciousness becomes both more apparent and more mysterious. Are we on the brink of creating a new form of life, or merely sophisticated tools? These are the questions that drive my research and ignite my curiosity.

Through my work, I aim to contribute to the understanding of AI not only as a technical discipline but also as a philosophical exploration. I invite you to join me on this journey, as we delve into the fascinating and often unsettling world of Artificial Intelligence.
