I am Félix Doublet from France, and I am currently pursuing my passion for Artificial Intelligence through research at the [SMILAB lab](https://smilab.org/en/) at Keio University, where I am a Master's student.

## Background

I have a generalist engineering background from one of the best French engineering school [Ecole Centrale de Nantes](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/) and French 'Classes préparatoires'. I then decided pursue both my interest for Artificial Intelligence and my passion for Japanese culture by doing a double degree in Japan.

## Research interests

I am especially interested in foundation models and their applications.

## My passions

I am passionate about Japanese culture, and I have been learning Japanese for 3 years. I am also a big fan of sports, especially football, tennis and Formula One.
