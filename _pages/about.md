I am Félix Doublet from France, and I am currently pursuing my passion for Artificial Intelligence through research at the [SMILAB lab](https://smilab.org/en/) at Keio University, where I am a Master's student. My journey in AI is driven by a curiosity to understand the intersection between human cognition and machine intelligence. This website serves as a window into my research, thoughts, and ongoing projects in the realm of AI.

## Background

I am currently a Master’s student at Keio University, where I am involved in cutting-edge AI research at the SMILAB lab. My academic background is deeply rooted in engineering, where I have focused on the intricacies of machine learning and its applications. My studies have equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI, which I continue to build upon through my research.

Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of working on several interdisciplinary projects that bridge the gap between AI and other fields, such as neuroscience and cognitive science. These experiences have enriched my understanding of how AI can be used to model complex systems and contribute to a broader understanding of intelligence, both artificial and human.
