The black-box nature of neural network models sometimes masks the underlying logic of their inference processes. This opacity presents significant challenges in verifying the validity of the modelsâ€™ predictions. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) stands out as a well-established method that transparently traces the flow of a model's prediction backward through its architecture by backpropagating relevance scores. However, LRP has not fully considered the existence of a skip connection, and its application to the widely used ResNet architecture has not been thoroughly explored.
